# Vanilla Single Page Prototype

A small prototype built solely for a college presentation. No technical concerns were prioritized no backend, authentication, architecture, standards, or best practices.
The goal was simply to show the concept working.

## How it works

A simple SPA built with plain **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
Everything is manual, with no frameworks — just enough to simulate screens and basic flow.

---

## Running locally

```bash
npx serve
```

Open the address shown in the terminal and you're good to go.

## Hosting

The project is hosted on **Cloudflare Pages** since it’s static and lightweight.
